# Toggle Safety Mod
I made this script to prevent misclicking of Right-click button. This script was intended for Half-Life 2(Including all episodes and lost coast), but it should work on most Source Engine games.
I decided to move my work on GitHub. Due to GameBanana being strict, we decided to move all of our scripts to GitHub repository.

# Description
Are you tired of pressing the MOUSE2 attack by accident? Well, this script will protect your MOUSE2 attack with this script!

To turn on Weapon Safety Mode, press MOUSE3(Mouse Wheel) key(by default).
To turn off Weapon Safety Mode, press MOUSE3 key again.

You can always change the MOUSE3 key you want to change.

This game was supposed to be used on Half-Life 2 based games(e.g. Half-Life 2, Episode One, Episode Two, Lost Coast, etc.), but should work with other games which supports secondary attack key.

To install this script, go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life 2\hl2\cfg(For Half-Life 2 by example) and create cfg file named autoexec.cfg. Then paste the script from my autoexec.cfg in this repository. Done!
